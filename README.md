This is an assignment of designing agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. There are 4 types of agents:
+ Reflex Agent: An agent that only considers the current information to choose actions and does not think further.
+ Minimax Agent: An agent using an adversarial search algorithm to evaluate the minimax value of each node in the fully expanded game state tree, and choose the optimal action accordingly.
+ AlphaBeta Agent: An agent using an adversarial search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to decide the action.
+ ExpectiMax Agent: An agent using an adversarial search algorithm to evaluate the expectimax value of each node in the fully expanded game state tree, and choose the optimal action accordingly.

Finally, we design a better evaluation function for the reflex agent to achieve a higher winning rate against a random ghost.
